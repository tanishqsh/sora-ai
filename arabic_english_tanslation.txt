This stadium embraces the match in an atmosphere filled with noise, magic, and intense football passion. And certainly, it's at a very important—and perhaps most dangerous—turning point in the league. These are six-point matches, not just three. Six points for Cristiano, not just three points. Who will respond tonight? Who will answer the call and secure the precious victory, getting one step closer—or taking a major step—towards winning the league title? The road is still very long, of course. It's a three-way race for the league title.

That was a classic Karim play, but he was offside. On the right of the screen, Benzema was offside. A long, precise ball, a header attempt, it returns to Otávio. He tries to pass, gets past Karti, keeps the ball—Otávio changes the direction of play but it goes out for a side throw.

First attack, Brozović touches it to Jalo. The ball returns to Karti. Tonight is a special match—watch the duel between Otávio and Karti. Karim on the left side, Benzema, a dangerous attempt! But blocked in front of Meta, on the Simakan side, who is showing up stronger and stronger in each game. He has become a key player.

Excitement rises with threatening moves—Bergwijn shoots—oh my God! What a strike! What a ball! A powerful shot by Bergwijn—and Bento stands strong. Bento holds it! He succeeds in this challenge. One of the few shots on target in this match.

Back to Laporte... it seems a goal is coming soon. It’s close. A goal could come at any moment—from either side. A thunderous stadium awaits the first goal. Will it be Antelo? Antelo tries to pass to Riona—it reaches Musati. Ronaldo tries to get past the first defender, keeps the ball, earns a foul. The play continues.

Back to Musati of Al-Ittihad—it’s a counter for Aouar. He changes direction beautifully towards Karim. Al-Aboud is making a run—a dangerous chance for Al-Ittihad. The ball falls to Karim, he shoots! What a move! What a beautiful shot! A solid save. Benzema’s shot headed to goal, but Bento denied it.

The crowd roars in excitement. The energy is electric. We see it again—Bergwijn’s cross, a defensive error. Al-Ittihad increasing pressure in Al-Nassr’s half, looking for the opener in this intense match. Kanté tries to break through, passes to Mohannad, then crosses into the left wing. He sends in a dangerous cross, but the defender clears it—barely.

Now Aouar has it. Aouar, playing well on the left today. Abdurrahman Al-Aboud tries something. A beautiful one-two with Aouar—great technique! But the ball goes loose, and a foul is called in favor of Abdurrahman Al-Aboud.

Ghanam talks with the referee—Al-Suqour is officiating. The referee indicates there was contact, so it’s a foul. All this while Al-Aboud receives medical attention. 28... now 29 minutes played. Is it time for the first goal?

We wait. The ball is for Aouar—to take a dangerous free kick. Pereira, Fabinho, Benzema, Talisca, and the others await. Al-Nassr is defending deep now, trying to maintain their position in this crucial game. A potential chance for Al-Ittihad here.

Aouar again—low cross—dangerous! But the defense clears it. Back to Laporte, to Berozuk, then Kanté on the wing. Beautiful control by Aouar. He tries to pass several players—still in possession. Laporte gets it, then Al-Nassr recovers, but a throw-in is awarded.

Bravo, Abdurrahman. Bravo! A respectful gesture after stopping the ball in front of Ronaldo. He says, “I was just trying to clear the ball.” No harm intended. Cristiano faces a tough crowd here at Al-Ittihad stadium.

Tense moments ahead. The ball goes out for a throw-in from Sadio Mané. Coach Pioli looks nervous. He knows Al-Ittihad had several big chances. Bento saved once, defense saved again—Al-Ittihad is truly dangerous lately.

Now the ball is in midfield. Pioli urges his players to stay compact, confident, and fight for a positive result tonight.

Back to Simakan—Simakan changes direction—passes to Ghanam. Backward passes, searching for space or solution—long ball by Simakan—Pereira under pressure but performs well.

Now the Al-Nassr fans cheer loudly, fully believing their team can win the league. A long pass—dangerous chance! Sadio, one-on-one with Mohannad—he crosses! But no one is there to receive. The ball seems to have gone out.

The referee assistant signals it’s a goal kick. Talisca isn’t playing this match. Pioli is relying on Angelo on the right and Sadio on the left for more attacking freedom. Otávio in midfield.

But the real match is in the stands. The atmosphere in Jeddah’s Jewel Stadium is amazing, despite legendary players on the field. The fans are stealing the show.

Back to Bento, to Boushal—a header—then to Sadio Mané. Keeps possession—left flank—dangerous chance for Boushal! Al-Nassr’s attack is promising. Boushal tries to make a move—but no support. A beautiful solo attempt—but he hesitates.

Play continues—ref signals a foul on Bergwijn. A solo effort by Nawaf—some thought he was offside, but he wasn’t. Ref let it go. He beat one, then another—but Ronaldo and Otávio were too far. Angelo tried to make a pass—but it was too late. Chance missed.

Back to Shingiti—tries to pass, intercepted, throw-in.

Coach Laurent Blanc had a rough start to the season but earned full trust after an impressive run. The team has been performing well across competitions—except for one loss in the league.

Now the ball is with Aouar—passes to Bergwijn on the left—keeps the ball, waiting for support—crosses it! Dangerous—but in Bento’s hands.

Great performance by both sides—especially Bento. Ronaldo flagged offside again. Loud chants—black and yellow fill the stadium—Al-Ittihad fans in full voice. Al-Nassr fans also present in force.
